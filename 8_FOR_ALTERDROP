-- Create Department table
CREATE TABLE Department (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create Employee table with foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id)
);

-- Insert into Department
INSERT INTO Department (department_id, department_name)
VALUES (1, 'Engineering'),

INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, employee_name, department_id)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 1),

ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Employee
